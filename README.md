# NoPhoneSpam

Web site: https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/NoPhoneSpam/

NoPhoneSpam is a simple app that allows you to

* block unwanted calls from certain numbers or private numbers,
* enter numbers to be blocked with wildcards (for instance, you can block whole prefixes or companies),
* get notified about blocked calls (optional),
* view statistics about which caller was blocked how often and when they have called the last time.

NoPhoneSpam is not intended as a feature-rich call-spam fighting app,
but as a replacement for Android's missing call blocking feature.

If you have Android 6+, you don't need this app, because call blocking
should be supported natively.
